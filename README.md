# Will Ferrari Win The Constructors Championship?

<p>
With one race to go, Ferrari can still win the Constructors
Championship. There is a 21 point gap between them and McLaren.
<br />
But there is still a chance that Red Bull can steal second place from
them if they fumble hard and Perez decides to turn up.
</p>
<p>
Charles Leclerc still has a reasonable chance of securing second place
in the Drivers Championship. The gap between him and Lando Norris is
only 8 points.
<br />
Carlos Sainz can still mathematically secure fourth place in the Drivers
Championship if he outscores Pisatri by 19 points.
